## 2. IP Addressing & Subnetting

### IPv4 Structure

  - Class A: 10.0.0.0/8
  - Class B: 172.16.0.0/12
  - Class C: 192.168.0.0/16

### Key Differences: IP vs MAC Address
| IP Address | MAC Address |
|------------|-------------|
| Logical address (Layer 3) | Physical address (Layer 2) |
| Can change depending on network | Fixed for a device |
| Used for routing | Used for local network delivery |
| 32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit (IPv6) | 48-bit address |

### Subnetting Basics
- **Purpose**: Dividing a network for security, performance, and better address management
- **Benefits**:
  - Improves network performance by reducing broadcast domains
  - Enhances security by isolating groups
  - Conserves IP addresses by allocating specific subnets
- **Subnet Mask**: Determines network vs host portion
- **CIDR Notation**: 192.168.1.0/24 means 24 network bits
- **Host Calculation**: Number of usable hosts = 2^(32 - subnet mask bits) - 2
  - Example: /26 subnet = 2^6 - 2 = 62 usable hosts
- **Subnetting Formula**: 2^n subnets, 2^h-2 hosts per subnet

### IPv6
- 128-bit address, 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits
