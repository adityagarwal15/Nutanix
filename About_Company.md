## üè¢ Nutanix in 3 Minutes

**What they do**: Make data centers simple by combining everything into one smart system  
**Founded**: 2009, San Jose, California  
**Size**: 7,000+ employees  
**Culture**: Hungry, Humble, Honest, with Heart  
**Mission**: Make computing invisible anywhere - seamless IT operations

**The Problem They Solved**: 
Companies used to need three separate, expensive things:
1. **Compute**: Servers with brains (CPU) and memory (RAM)
2. **Storage**: Big boxes full of hard drives to store data  
3. **Networking**: Wires and switches to connect everything

**Nutanix's Solution**: Combine all three into one smart box controlled by software - like how smartphones combined phone + camera + music player into one device.

**Modern Benefits**: Built-in self-healing, disaster recovery, and automation

## üîß HCI (Hyperconverged Infrastructure) - The Core Concept

**Simple definition**: HCI is the name for combining compute, storage, and networking into one system

- **"Converged"** = brought together  
- **"Hyper"** = done in a smart, software-controlled way

**Old way**: Separate servers + storage arrays + networking devices = complex and expensive  
**HCI way**: Industry-standard servers running distributed software = simple and efficient  

**Modern HCI includes**: Built-in resilience, self-healing, disaster recovery, automation, and support for containers/cloud-native apps

**Why it matters**: Companies can manage hundreds of applications from one simple interface instead of juggling multiple complicated systems
